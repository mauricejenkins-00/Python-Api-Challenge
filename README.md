Part 1 Analysis: There does seem to be a strong correlation between wind speed and latitude when you look at the plots. 
Still, the linear regresion shows a much lower correlation than it appears. 
There is a definite correlation in both hemispheres, in that the further you are from the equator, the higher the wind speeds are, but the slope of the regression line is much thinner from glancing at the plots.
