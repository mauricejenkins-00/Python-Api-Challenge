# Python Api Challenge

Background
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

Part 1 Analysis: There does seem to be a strong correlation between wind speed and latitude when you look at the plots. 
Still, the linear regresion shows a much lower correlation than it appears. 
There is a definite correlation in both hemispheres, in that the further you are from the equator, the higher the wind speeds are, but the slope of the regression line is much thinner from glancing at the plots.
